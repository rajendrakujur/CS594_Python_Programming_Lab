He hesitated, knowing that the truth would only hurt. How was he going to tell her that the best way for him to get what he wanted was to leave her?
She patiently waited for his number to be called. She had no desire to be there, but her mom had insisted that she go. She's resisted at first, but 
over time she realized it was simply easier to appease her and go. Mom tended to be that way. She would keep insisting until you wore down and did 
what she wanted. So, here she sat, patiently waiting for her number to be called.The chair sat in the corner where it had been for over 25 years. 
The only difference was there was someone actually sitting in it. How long had it been since someone had done that? Ten years or more he imagined. 
Yet there was no denying the presence in the chair now. According to the caption on the bronze marker placed by the Multnomah Chapter of the 
Daughters of the American Revolution on May 12, 1939, “College Hall (is) the oldest building in continuous use for Educational purposes west of 
the Rocky Mountains. Here were educated men and women who have won recognition throughout the world in all the learned professions.”
Sleeping in his car was never the plan but sometimes things don't work out as planned. This had been his life for the last three months and he was 
just beginning to get used to it. He didn't actually enjoy it, but he had accepted it and come to terms with it. Or at least he thought he had. 
All that changed when he put the key into the ignition, turned it and the engine didn't make a sound.Don't be scared. The things out there that are 
unknown aren't scary in themselves. They are just unknown at the moment. Take the time to know them before you list them as scary. Then the world will
be a much less scary place for you.

All that changed when he put the key into the ignition, turned it and the engine didn't make a sound.Don't be scared. The things out there that are 
unknown aren't scary in themselves. They are just unknown at the moment. Take the time to know them before you list them as scary. Then the world will
be a much less scary place for you."What is the best way to get what you want?" she asked. He looked down at the ground knowing that she wouldn't like his answer. 
He hesitated, knowing that the truth would only hurt. How was he going to tell her that the best way for him to get what he wanted was to leave her?
She patiently waited for his number to be called. She had no desire to be there, but her mom had insisted that she go. She's resisted at first, but 
over time she realized it was simply easier to appease her and go. Mom tended to be that way. She would keep insisting until you wore down and did 
what she wanted. So, here she sat, patiently waiting for her number to be called.The chair sat in the corner where it had been for over 25 years. 
The only difference was there was someone actually sitting in it. How long had it been since someone had done that? Ten years or more he imagined. 
Yet there was no denying the presence in the chair now. According to the caption on the bronze marker placed by the Multnomah Chapter of the

the Rocky Mountains. Here were educated men and women who have won recognition throughout the world in all the learned professions.”

Sleeping in his car was never the plan but sometimes things don't work out as planned. This had been his life for the last three months and he was 
just beginning to get used to it. He didn't actually enjoy it, but he had accepted it and come to terms with it. Or at least he thought he had. 
All that changed when he put the key into the ignition, turned it and the engine didn't make a sound.Don't be scared. The things out there that are 
unknown aren't scary in themselves. They are just unknown at the moment. Take the time to know them before you list them as scary. Then the world will
be a much less scary place for you."What is the best way to get what you want?" she asked. He looked down at the ground knowing that she wouldn't like his answer. 
He hesitated, knowing that the truth would only hurt. How was he going to tell her that the best way for him to get what he wanted was to leave her?
She patiently waited for his number to be called. She had no desire to be there, but her mom had insisted that she go. She's resisted at first, but 
over time she realized it was simply easier to appease her and go. Mom tended to be that way. She would keep insisting until you wore down and did 
what she wanted. So, here she sat, patiently waiting for her number to be called.The chair sat in the corner where it had been for over 25 years. 
The only difference was there was someone actually sitting in it. How long had it been since someone had done that? Ten years or more he imagined. 
Yet there was no denying the presence in the chair now. According to the caption on the bronze marker placed by the Multnomah Chapter of the
