	1. Write python programs to do the following:
  	a) Read in a sequence of numbers into a list
  	b) Remove the element at index x  from the list.
  	c) Insert a number n at  an  index k in a list
  	d) Display the number at index k



	2. Write a program using for loop to display produce the list of squares of each element  of a list; If the given list is [5,8,2,1,7], you are expected to create and display the list [25,6,4,1,49]



	3. The input is a list of integers  less that 97. Compute the product of the sub list from index i to j using the range function. The product must be computed mod 97.



	4. Write a python program that reads in a list of triangles (assume any suitable format for reading the input) and produce an output list containing the areas of the triangle.



	5.Write a python program to play the  two games  desribed in class

	(I) Make a simple game, You will be given n marbles and the player can take at max k, at min 1 marbles from there.The player that removes the last marble wins the game (Using lists is must)

	(a) First make it a one player vs one computer game
	(b) Secondly, make it as a Player_1 vs Player_2 game

	(II) There are n people sitten in a circular table, Every time the next kth person gets a phone call(from current index) and he leaves the table,

	Make a program to print the sequence how did they recieve the call
	and who was the last person to leave the table.(Use lists)
